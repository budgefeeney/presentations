# README

This is an interactive document exploring the the limits of cross-validation's usefulness by explicitly linking it to jackknife sampling, and thence re-using existing results on Jackknife Resampling to characterise cross-validation.

To run the notebooks you will need to have installed Anaconda. Once installed, you should use it to create the environment and install its dependencies by typing

    conda env create --file environment.yml

To run the notebooks type

    conda activate jackknife-validation
    jupyter-lab

to launch Jupyter-Lab, and then open the notebook `Bayesian Metrics Evaluation.ipynb`.
